Code examples for programming AWS Lambda with different programming languages:

- Node.js / JavaScript
- Python
- Java
- C#

The code samples were created using the serverless framework (for Node.js, Python), Eclipse (for Java), and Visual Studio 2015 (for C#), respectively.

A video tutorial that I recorded in March 2017 can be purchased via Pack Publishing: <https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/learning-aws-lambda-video>. In the video, I explain the basic programming and deployment model for AWS Lambda and I show how to combine AWS Lambda with other AWS services, in particular, with API Gateway Service, DynamoDB, and S3, using different programming languages for implementing the business logic (namely, JavaScript/NodeJS, Java, Python, and C#/.NET).

You can also view an older video that I recorded in March 2016 and published on YouTube: <https://youtu.be/1lYNuR2LwMw> (the older video is for free, however, slightly outdated and not as professionally recorded as the one that you can buy from Pack Publishing).
